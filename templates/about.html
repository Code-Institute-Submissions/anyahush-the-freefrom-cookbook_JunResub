            <h6>Welcome to The FreeFrom CookBook!</h6>
            <p>Here we want to help make cooking easier for those with food allergies. Cooking, eating out and sharing
                meals can often be difficult or stressful for those allergies.
                Not sure if 100% safe and trusting that someone else has understood fully.
            </p>
            <p>
                We wanted to create a place that anyone with an allergy can find, friends and family, those who work in hospitality or people exploring and curious can and 
                learn, get recipe ideas and add to our ever growing library!
                We want to change the perception that just because something is gluten or lactose free, for example, it doesn't
                have to be dull, tasteless or uninspiring.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course there is a safety aspect to this too. Food allergies can be fatal for some and with high levels of processed foods and condiments used these days, we want
                to help people learn what to look out for.
